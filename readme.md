# faHy - femtoAmpere/FurAffinity Hydrus Browser Extension for FurAffinity Classic Users

This is a simple browser extension I wrote for personal use to send FurAffinity.net submissions to Hydrus via API.
It adds a small button to the submission title **in classic layout**, saying something like

![[ Send to Hydrus ]](images/example.png)

## Using faHy

- Install like <https://gitgud.io/prkc/hydrus-companion>
- Please put your Hydrus importer credentials in `background.js`

## More Information

- **Only tested in Google Chrome.**
- This has to be an extension and cannot only be an injected script (e.g. Tampermonkey) due to CORS policy.
